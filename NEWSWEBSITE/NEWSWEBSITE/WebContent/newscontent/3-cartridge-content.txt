Police sources have told India Today TV that the cartridges that were found in Kollam district of Kerala could be of Pakistan origin since 'POF' markings were found on them.

POF stands for Pakistan Ordnance Factories. This, however, needs to be ascertained through a detailed probe. Senior police officers will also inspect the bullets.

Kulathupuzha police recovered 14 live bullets abandoned near a bridge in Kollam. State police chief Lokanath Behara has said that Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Kerala Police will probe this incident.

During the investigation, the initial assessment was that the bullets were foreign made.

According to the police, 7.62mm bullets used in long-range rifles were found abandoned in Kulathupuzha region.

At least two people who were travelling on a bike spotted a suspicious cover on the roadside. On inspection, the duo found the bullets.

Based on the information, Kulathupuzha Police reached the spot and recovered the bullets.
