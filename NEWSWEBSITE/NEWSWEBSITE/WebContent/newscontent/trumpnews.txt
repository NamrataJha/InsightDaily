President Donald Trump will be accompanied on the India visit by at least three members of his cabinet and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has emerged as the president’s right-hand man on some of the administration’s key foreign policy priorities and engagements.

The three secretaries will be Steve Mnuchin of treasury, Wilbur Ross of commerce and Secretary Dan Brouillette of energy, according to people familiar with the planning of the visit, who also pointed out that these lists could change with additions and eliminations. There was was no word if Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative and top negotiator, will join the delegation. He cancelled a visit to New Delhi scheduled for last week to wrap up discussion on a trade deal, putting a question mark on what was once expected to be the defining achievement of Trump’s visit.
