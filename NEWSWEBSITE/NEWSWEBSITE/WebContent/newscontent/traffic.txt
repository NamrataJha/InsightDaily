'I looked at you. You looked at me. Aur ho gayi mushkil' Gurugram Traffic Police tweeted.
After the viral Kabir Singh meme aimed at encouraging road safety, Gurugram Traffic Police's Twitter handle is back once again with a hilarious meme that is tickling netizens' funny bones.

The meme, which is a play on a Bollywood song, tries to promote wearing helmets by demonstrating the trouble a rider without a helmet can get in while riding a two-wheeler in Gurugram.

"I looked at you. You looked at me. Aur ho gayi mushkil (And there was trouble)," Gurugram Traffic Police tweeted. The lines belong to the popular Bollywood song "Dus Bahane" from the 2005 film 'Dus'. Incidentally, the song has recently been remade as part of the Tiger Shroff-starrer film 'Baghi 3' which is set for a March 6 release.
